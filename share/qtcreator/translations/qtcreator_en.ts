  This file is created by hand and should only be used to fix
  spelling errors in the default english texts.
  Do NOT use this file to change the meaning of strings,
  because changes made in this file are NOT visible to translators
  into other languages, which would result in the wrong meaning
  still being translated into other languages.

  The changes done in this file should be transferred to the tr()
  calls before the string freeze for the next version of Qt Creator.
  The source tags in existing translations should be adapted accordingly
  to not loose the translation.

        \li Pin files to the top of the list to keep them open when you
            select \uicontrol {Close All}.
        \li Assign keyboard shortcuts for opening the next and previous
            document in the list (\uicontrol OpenNextDocument and

            select whether you want to be prompted to reload open files
            that were modified externally. For example, when you pull
            changes from a version control system.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Auto-save modified files} check box to
            automatically save changed files at the intervals specified in

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Auto-suspend unmodified files} check
            box to automatically free the resources of open files after
            prolonged inactivity. The files are still listed in the
            \uicontrol {Open Documents} view. Set the minimum number of files
            that should be kept in memory in the \uicontrol {Files to keep open}
            field.
        \li Select the \uicontrol {Warn before opening text files greater than}
            check box to receive warnings about opening big text files.

    \title Set high DPI scaling

    The operating systems that \QC supports implement high dots-per-inch (DPI)
    scaling at varying levels. Therefore, \QC handles \l{High DPI}{high DPI}
    scaling differently on different operating systems:

    \list
        \li On \macos, \QC forces high DPI scaling, which means that it allows
            Qt to use the system scaling factor as the \QC scaling factor.
        \li On Linux, \QC leaves it to the user to enable high DPI scaling
            because the process varies so much on different distributions
            and windowing systems that it cannot be reliably done automatically.
    \endlist

    Setting the scale factor or DPI to the exact physical display DPI may not
    give good visual results due to the fractional scaling involved.
    \l {Qt::HighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy}{Rounding} the scale factor to 25%
    increments can improve the results.

    To set the DPI rounding policy:

        \list 1
            \li Select \preferences >
                \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol Interface.
                \image {qtcreator-preferences-environment-interface.webp} {Interface tab in Environment preferences}
            \li In \uicontrol {DPI rounding policy}, select an option to round
                DPI up or down.
            \li Restart \QC to have the change take effect.
    \endlist

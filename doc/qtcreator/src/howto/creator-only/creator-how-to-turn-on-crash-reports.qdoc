    \title Turn on crash reports

    \QC uses \l{Google Breakpad} to collect information about crashes and to send it
    to \l{Sentry: Security & Compliance}{Sentry} for processing. Breakpad might
    capture arbitrary contents from the memory of the crashed process, including
    user-sensitive information, URLs, and other content users have trusted
    \QC with. However, the crash reports are used for the sole purpose of fixing
    software errors.

    To turn on crash reports:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol System.
            \image {qtcreator-preferences-environment-system.webp} {System tab in Environment preferences}
        \li Select \uicontrol {Enable crash reporting}.
    \endlist

    Crash reports are sent automatically if they don't exceed the file size
    limit that Sentry sets for accepting them. You are not notified about
    sending the reports or whether it succeeded or failed.

    \section1 Clear local crash reports

    \QC stores crash reports on the computer in the following directories:

    \list
        \li On Windows: \c {%APPDATA%\QtProject\qtcreator\crashpad_reports}
        \li On Linux and \macos:
            \c {$HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/crashpad_reports}
    \endlist

    To free up disk space that crash reports reserve on the computer,
    select \uicontrol {Clear Local Crash Reports}. You can see the
    size of the crash reports next to the button.

    Select \uicontrol ? to view more information about Breakpad and the security
    policy.

    \note The best way to report a crash is to create a bug report where you
    paste the corresponding stack trace.

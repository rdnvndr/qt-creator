            \uicontrol {Use external repository}.
    \endlist

    To add several repositories, select \uicontrol {Add}.

    \section1 Security considerations

    \QC does not check extensions from external vendors for security flaws or
    malicious intent, so be careful when installing them, as it might leave your
    computer vulnerable to attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing.

    Before you install an extension from an external vendor:

    \list
        \li Check that the extension is compatible with your \QC version and
            other extensions that you install. You can find this information in
            the description of the extension in the \uicontrol Extensions mode.
        \li Check what other users are saying about the extension and how they
            rate it.
        \li Make sure the vendor is reputable and known for creating high-quality
            extensions.
        \li Check that the extension package was recently updated. Outdated
            extensions present a bigger risk.
        \li Check that the extension has good documentation and other means of
            support.
        \li Check that the extension mostly has features that you need.
            All extensions that are loaded on start make \QC start a bit slower.
    \endlist

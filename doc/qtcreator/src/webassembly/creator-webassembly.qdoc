    \title Build applications for the Web

    WebAssembly is a binary format that allows sand-boxed executable code in
    web pages. This format is nearly as fast as native machine code. It is
    supported by all major web browsers.

    Use \l {Qt for WebAssembly} to build your applications in WebAssembly format
    and deploy and run them on the local web browser. Change the web browser in
    the project's \l{Run applications in a web browser}{run settings}.

    \note Enable the WebAssembly plugin to use it.

    To build applications for the web and run them in a web browser, install
    Qt for WebAssembly with \l{Get and Install Qt}{\QOI}. It automatically adds
    a build and run kit to \QC.

    \section1 Set up WebAssembly development environment

    To set up the development environment for WebAssembly:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol SDKs > \uicontrol WebAssembly.
        \li In \uicontrol {Emscripten SDK path}, enter the root directory where
            you installed \c emsdk.
        \li \QC configures the \uicontrol {Emscripten SDK environment} for you
            if your Qt for WebAssembly version supports the \c emsdk.
            \image {qtcreator-preferences-sdks-webassembly.webp} {WebAssembly tab in SDKs preferences}
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol Kits.
            \image {qtcreator-kit-webassembly.webp} {Qt for WebAssembly kit in the Kits tab in Kits preferences}
        \li In \uicontrol {Build device}, select \uicontrol Desktop as the device
            type.
        \li In \uicontrol {Run device}, select \uicontrol {WebAssembly Runtime}
            as the device type.
        \li If \uicontrol {Emscripten Compiler} was not automatically set
            for both C++ and C, check that emscripten is set up correctly.
        \li In \uicontrol {Qt version}, select a Qt for WebAssembly version.
    \endlist

    \title Setting up a 3D scene
    \sa {Content Library}
    \brief Illustrates how to set up a 3D scene with, for example, lights, models, and materials in
    \QDS.

    \image 3d-scene-tutorial.webp

    The \e {Setting up a 3D scene} tutorial illustrates how you can set up and improve a 3D
    scene with the following:
    \list
      \li 3D models
      \li Materials
      \li Lights
      \li Environmental lights
      \li Background images
    \endlist

    The assets you use in this tutorial are available in the \uicontrol {Content Library} view.

    To follow this tutorial, you need to first download the starting project from
    \l{https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/tutorial%20projects/3Dscene%20tutorial/Start}{here}.

    Download the completed project from
    \l{https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/tutorial%20projects/3Dscene%20tutorial/Completed/}{here}.

    To learn the basics of \QDS required to complete this tutorial, see \l{Getting started}.

    \section1 The starting project

    The starting project consists of an animated 3D model of a ball bearing. Control the animations
    with a slider and a switch in the user interface.

    Besides the 3D model, the 3D scene also has the default camera and the default directional
    light.

    \include run-tutorial-project.qdocinc

    \section1 Adding materials to the 3D models

    First, use materials from the \uicontrol {Content Library} view on the ball bearing:

    \list 1
      \li In the \uicontrol 3D view, right-click the ball bearing and select
        \uicontrol {Edit Component}.
        \image 3d-scene-edit-component-menu.png
      \li From the \uicontrol {Content Library} view, drag materials to the different parts of
          the ball bearing in the \uicontrol Navigator view.
        Drag the following materials to the following parts:
        \list
          \li Chrome to \e inner_race and \e outer_race.
          \li Copper to \e balls.
          \li Gold to \e retainer.
          \li Carbon Fiber to \e shield_left and \e shield_right.
        \endlist
        \note The first time you use an asset from the \uicontrol {Content Library} view, you
              need to download it.
        \image 3d-scene-drag-material.png
      \li Select \e {Screen01.ui.qml} in the breadcrumb in the top menu bar to return to the 3D
        scene.
        \image 3d-scene-bread-crumb.png
    \endlist
    When you run the application or \uicontrol {Live Preview}, notice that you don't see much of the materials.
    The next step is to set up the environmental light.

    \section1 Adding environmental lighting to the scene

    Environmental lighting is a good way to create a realistic light for your scene.

    To add environmental lighting:

    \list 1
      \li In the \uicontrol {Content Library} view, go to the \uicontrol Environments tab.
      \li Right-click the image \e BasicLights3_4k.hdr and select \uicontrol {Add Light Probe}.
      \image 3d-scene-add-light-probe.webp
      Setting an image as a light probe for a scene adds the image as the source for the image-based
      lighting and also sets it as a skybox, meaning that the same image is used as the background
      in the scene.
    \endlist

    When you run the application, notice an improvement in the scene lighting.

    As you will add a background image to the scene later, you need to disable the use of skybox:

    \list 1
      \li In the \uicontrol Navigator view, select \e sceneEnvironment.
      \li Go to the \uicontrol {Scene Environment} tab in \uicontrol Properties and set \uicontrol
      {Background Mode} to \uicontrol Transparent.
    \endlist

    You also want to increase the brightness of the light a bit. Go to the \uicontrol {Image Based
    Lighting} tab in \uicontrol Properties and set \uicontrol Exposure to \e 10.

    \section2 Adding a background image to the scene

    In the final step of this tutorial, you add a background image to your scene:

    \list 1
      \li Go to the \uicontrol Textures tab in the \uicontrol {Content Library} view.
      \li Right-click the image \e 4kScratchySurface.png and select \uicontrol {Add Texture}.
      \image 3d-scene-add-texture.webp
      This adds the image as a texture to the project. It is now available in the \uicontrol Assets
      view.
      \li From the \uicontrol Assets view, drag \e 4KScratchySurface.png to \e Rectangle in the
      \uicontrol Navigator view.
      \li Go to the \uicontrol Layout tab in \uicontrol Properties and set \uicontrol Anchors to
      \uicontrol FillParentComponent.
      \image 3d-scene-fill-parent.png
      \li Go to the \uicontrol Image tab and set \uicontrol {Fill Mode} to \uicontrol Stretch.
      \li The background is rendered on top of the 3D scene as it is located at the bottom of the
      \uicontrol Navigator view.
      With the background image selected, select the down arrow to move it to the top of the
      hierarchy.

    \endlist

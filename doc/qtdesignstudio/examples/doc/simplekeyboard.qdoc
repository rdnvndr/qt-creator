    \brief Illustrates how to use a virtual keyboard in an application.

    \title Simple keyboard

    \e {Simple keyboard} provides a virtual keyboard for entering
    text into several text fields. It uses functionality from the
    \l{Qt Virtual Keyboard} module.

    The virtual keyboard is automatically displayed when users start entering
    text into \l{Text Edit} or \l{Text Input} components. For more information
    about using it, see \l{User Guide}{Virtual Keyboard: User Guide}.

    To test the virtual keyboard, select the run dropdown in the top toolbar,
    and then select \uicontrol Run to run the example on the desktop or a device.
    The keyboard is not available during preview.

    \section1 Using a virtual keyboard

    First, we create an empty project, as described in \l {Creating projects}.
    For the purposes of this example, we call the project \e SimpleKeyboard.
    We can use the default settings for other options, but we need to select
    the \uicontrol {Use Qt Virtual Keyboard} check box on the
    \uicontrol {Define Project Details} page.

    The project wizard template adds the Qt Quick Virtual Keyboard module
    to the project and creates a component based on \l InputPanel in
    \e SimpleKeyboard.qml.

    We then create a tabbed UI that contains fields for entering text, among
    other things. The virtual keyboard is automatically enabled for the text
    edit and text input controls.

    \title Accessing output, issue, and warning messages

    \image {studio-output-view.webp} {The Qt Design Studio Output view.}

    \QDS projects generate output information that represent the
    executed processes. It also shows you the issues that stop a project from
    getting executed or gives you warnings about probable failures. Warning messages
    generated in the \uicontrol Issues relate to the code and design problems,
    and warning messages generated in the \uicontrol Output relate to the
    runtime failures.

    \section1 Accessing the Output messages

    When you run a project, details about the runtime execution processes
    is listed in the output view. To access these messages, select
    \imageoutput.

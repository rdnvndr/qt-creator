    \title Jump to the Code

    Jump to the code is a feature that gives you instant access to a particular
    part of the code. It takes you to the \uicontrol {Code} view location of a particular
    component, \uicontrol {State}, or \uicontrol {Connection}.

    You can jump to the code from:
    \list
        \li The \uicontrol {Navigator} view
        \li The \uicontrol {2D} view
        \li The \uicontrol {States} view
        \li The \uicontrol {Connections} view
    \endlist

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the Navigator View

    \list 1
        \li Right-click on a component in the \uicontrol {Navigator} view.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \image {jump-to-the-code-from-navigator-view.webp} {Selecting Jump to the Code from the context menu in the Navigator view.}

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the 2D view

    \list 1
        \li Right-click on a component in the \uicontrol {2D} view.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \image {jump-to-the-code-from-2D-view.webp} {Selecting Jump to the Code from the context menu in the 2D view.}

    \note Alternatively, you can select the component in the \uicontrol {Navigator} view
    or in the \uicontrol {2D} view and select \key {F4}. That takes you to the code
    location in the \uicontrol {Code} view.

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the States view

    \list 1
        \li Locate the state you want to check in the \uicontrol {States} view.
        \li Select \imagebrowsebutton
            to open additional options.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Jump to the Code}.
    \endlist

    \image {jump-to-the-code-from-state-view.webp} {Selecting Jump to the Code from the context menu in the States view.}

    \section1 Jump to the Code from the Connections view

    \list 1
        \li Select a connection in the \uicontrol {Connections} view.
        \li Select \imagejumptocode16px
            to jump to the code segment related to the connection.
    \endlist

    \image {jump-to-the-code-from-connections-view.webp} {Selecting Jump to the Code from the context menu in the Connections view.}

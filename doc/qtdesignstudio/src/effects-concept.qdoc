Key features of the \QDS Effect Composer:

\list
  \li Enhance projects with a variety of customizable predefined effects.
  \li Write custom shader code to achieve tailored visual effects.
  \li Copy and paste shader code from platforms such as
  Shadertoy and The Book of Shaders into Effect Composer.
  \li Copy AI-generated shader code into Effect Composer.
\endlist

With \uicontrol {Effect Composer}, you can create visual effects without needing to understand shader languages. The
interface and tools are designed to facilitate the creation of precise and effective visual effects.

    \title Transitions

    \brief Make movement between states smooth.

    To make movement between states smooth, you can use
    \uicontrol {Transitions} to animate the changes between
    states.

    First, you need to \l{Working with states}{add states} in the \l States view
    and \l{Specifying component properties}{edit some properties} that can be
    animated, such as colors or numbers, in the \l Properties view. For example,
    you can animate the changes in the position of a component.

    In \uicontrol {Transitions}, you can set the start frame, end
    frame, and duration for the transition of each property. You can also
    set an \l{Editing easing curves}{easing curve} for each animation and
    the maximum duration of the whole transition.

    \section1 Zooming in Transitions

    Use the slider on the toolbar to set the zooming level in
    \uicontrol {Transitions}. Select the \imagezoomsmall
    and \imagezoombig
    buttons to zoom out of or into the view.

    \section1 Animating transitions between states

    To animate transitions:

    \list 1
        \li Select \uicontrol View > \uicontrol Views >
            \uicontrol {Transition Editor}.

        \li Select the \imageplus
            (\uicontrol {Add Transition}) button to add a transition. This
            works only if you have added at least one state and modified at
            least one property in it.

        \li Move the blue bar next to the component or property name to set
            the start and end frame of the animation of the property. Pull its
            left and right edges to set the duration of the animation.
        \li To attach an \l{Editing easing curves}{easing curve} to the
            selected transition, select the \imagecurveeditor
            (\uicontrol {Easing Curve Editor (C)}) button.
    \endlist

    \section1 Specifying transition settings

    To modify transition settings, select the \imagesettings
    (\uicontrol {Transition Settings (S)}) button in
    \uicontrol {Transition Editor}.

    \title Morph Target

    The \uicontrol {Morph Target} component can be used to define morph targets
    for vertex animation. Morph targets are the objects we bind to control
    the morphing of a model. Usually, morphing is controlled by using
    \l {Timeline}{timeline} animation or \l {Applying animations}{property animation}.
    The degree of morphing is controlled by defining the \uicontrol Weight
    property of the \uicontrol {Morph Target} component.

    The normal workflow is to use an external content creation tool to create
    a mesh, which also contains morph targets, and import it to \QDS.

    To add a morph target for a model in \QDS, drag a
    \uicontrol {Morph Target} component from \uicontrol Components
    > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} to \uicontrol Scene in
    \l Navigator. Then select the model in \uicontrol Navigator, and in
    \l Properties > \uicontrol Model > \uicontrol {Morph Targets}, select the
    name of the \uicontrol {Morph Target} component.

    \section1 Morph Target properties

    To define attributes and weight for a \uicontrol {Morph Target}, select it
    in \uicontrol Navigator and specify its properties in the
    \uicontrol Properties view.

    Use the \uicontrol Weight property to specify the weight of the
    \uicontrol {Morph Target}. The value of \uicontrol Weight functions as the
    multiplication factor used by the linear interpolation.
    If the value is set to 1, the target is fully applied.
    If the \uicontrol Weight property value is set to 0, it has no influence.

    Use the \uicontrol Attributes property to specify a set of attributes for the
    selected \uicontrol {Morph Target}. In order to animate vertex attributes
    in morphing, the mesh must contain those target attributes and the
    \uicontrol {Morph Target} must have the attributes enabled.

    Select the dropdown menu to choose one of the following attributes:
        \list
            \li \uicontrol Position animates the vertex positions.
            \li \uicontrol Normal animates the normal vectors.
            \li \uicontrol Tangent animates the tangent vectors.
            \li \uicontrol Binormal animates the binormal vectors.
        \endlist

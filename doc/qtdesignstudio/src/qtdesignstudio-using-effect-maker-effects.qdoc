    \title Using the Qt Quick Effect Maker effects

    \QQEM is integrated into \QDS for creating shader effects. To create an
    effect, you first create the effect file in \QDS, and then you edit it in \QQEM.

    For more information about \QQEM, see the
    \l{https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquickeffectmaker-index.html}{Qt Quick Effect Maker Manual}.

    \section1 Creating an effect file

    To create an effect file in \QDS:

    \list 1
      \li Right-click in the \uicontrol Assets view and
      select \uicontrol {New Effect}.
      \QDS creates an effect file and opens it in \QQEM.
      \image {qt-quick-effect-maker.webp} {The Qt Effect Maker default view.}
      \li Edit the effect.
      \li In \QQEM, go to \uicontrol File > \uicontrol Save.
      \li With the default settings, select \uicontrol OK.
      \image {effect-maker-export.png} {Qt Effect Maker export effect dialog.}
    \endlist

    Now, you can close \QQEM and return to \QDS and apply the
    effect.

    \section1 Applying an effect

    You can apply effects to components in \QDS. To do so, drag the effect
    from the \uicontrol Assets view to the component in the \uicontrol 2D or
    \uicontrol Navigator view.

    \title Developing applications for MCUs

    As a GUI/application developer, use \QDS to bring your designs to life. Add
    further functionality to your applications and utilize the \l {Prototyping}
    {prototyping} features of \QDS to simulate and validate interactions and
    their dynamic behavior.

    With \QDS, designers and developers can work together on common projects to
    develop applications. As a designer you can use the views in the \e Design
    mode to modify UI files (.ui.qml). For more information, see
    \l {Implementing applications}.

    With Qt Creator, you can test, preview, and fine-tune your designs directly
    on the desktop or on an actual MCU target device. As a developer you can use
    Qt Creator to work on the Qt Quick (.qml) and other files that are needed to
    implement the application logic and to prepare the application for production.
    For more information on how to use Qt Creator to develop applications for
    MCUs, see \l {Developing for MCUs} and \l {How To: Develop for MCUs}.
